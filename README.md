# entropique
a music information retrieval tool written in SuperCollider

it uses Pablo DiLiscia, Juan Pampin, and Pete Moss's ATS (Analysis, Transformation, Synthesis) based on a sinusoidal plus critical-band noise model. ATS files are provided here for testing, in order to create your own ATS files, visit https://sourceforge.net/projects/atsa/files/, where the source as well as an OS X binary can be found (binary requires XQuartz https://www.xquartz.org/).
